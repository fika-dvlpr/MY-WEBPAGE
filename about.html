				ONE PIECE</p>
			<p>One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has
				been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual
				chapters compiled into 100 tankōbon volumes as of September 2021. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D.
				Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his
				crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate
				treasure known as "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.
				The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film produced by Production I.G, and an
				anime series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally, Toei has
				developed fourteen animated feature films, one OVA and thirteen television specials. Several companies have
				developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The
				manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media
				and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an
				English-language release in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by
				Funimation in 2007.
				One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. It has received many
				awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. Several volumes of
				the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015,
				One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a
				single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only
				manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as
				the only that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its 100 published tankōbon volumes.
				As of July 2021, One Piece had over 490 million copies in circulation in 58 countries and regions worldwide,
				making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in book volume. It
				is also one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.</p>

				Premise
				The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man who, inspired by his childhood idol and powerful pirate "Red
				Haired" Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the titular treasure and proclaim himself
				the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 1] Luffy rescues and
				befriends a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the One Piece. They are joined in their
				journey by Nami, a navigator and thief; Usopp, a sniper and a pathological liar; and Vinsmoke Sanji, a perverted
				chef. They acquire a ship named the Going Merry[Jp 2] and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the
				East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series,
				including Tony Tony Chopper, a doctor and anthropomorphized reindeer; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former
				assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeletal musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a fish-man helmsman
				and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Once the Going Merry becomes damaged beyond repair, the
				Straw Hat Pirates acquire a new ship named the Thousand Sunny.[Jp 3] Together, they encounter other pirates,
				bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents and soldiers of the corrupt World
				Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.

				DEVELOPMENT</p>
			<p>
				Development
				When creating a Devil Fruit, Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire; he added that he does
				not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit's appearance would entice one to eat it.[32] The names
				of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases
				written in kanji are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of some characters' techniques are often
				mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are designed as jokes; they look
				fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's signature move is
				Onigiri, which is written as demon cut but is pronounced the same as rice ball in Japanese. Eisaku Inoue, the
				animation director, has said that the creators did not use these kanji readings in the anime since they "might
				have cut down the laughs by about half".[33] Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes
				that the creators "made the anime pretty close to the manga".[33]
				Oda was "sensitive" about how his work would be translated.[34] In many instances, the English version of the
				One Piece manga uses one onomatopoeia for multiple onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version. For instance,
				"saaa" (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and "zaaa" (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as
				"fshhhhhhh".[35] Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look
				while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn. In this way, he wishes to
				maintain a uniform representation, leaving only the realization of the backgrounds to his staff, based on his
				sketches.[36] This workload forces him to keep tight production rates, starting from five in the morning until
				two in the morning the next day, with short breaks only for meals. Oda's work program includes the first three
				days of the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of
				the boards and for the possible coloring.[37] When a reader asked who Nami was in love with, Oda replied that
				there would hardly be any love affairs within Luffy's crew. The author also explained he deliberately avoids
				including them in One Piece since the series is a shōnen manga and the boys who read it are not interested in
				love stories.[38]
